    <string name="hrm_duration_recommendation">For accurate heart rate measurement:\n    - Measure the pulse for 15 seconds and multiply by 4 to get the beats per minute (bpm).\n    - Alternatively, measure for 30 seconds and multiply by 2.\n    - For higher accuracy or irregular pulses, measure for a full 60 seconds.</string>

    <string name="step_recommendation">- For a healthy heart, we recommend walking at least 10,000 steps per day or engaging in 30-60 minutes of brisk walking daily. \n- Aim for a moderate intensity where you can talk but not sing comfortably. For additional benefits, include uphill or power walking.\n- Consistency is keyâ€”walk most days of the week to strengthen your heart and improve overall cardiovascular health.</string>
